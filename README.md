# shellfiles

Some shell customization scripts.

## Install

Run:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/lucasnga/shellfiles ~/.shellfiles
```

add to your main shell rc file (~/.bashrc or ~/.kshrc)

```shell
. /home/lucas/.shellfiles/.variables
. /home/lucas/.shellfiles/.functions
. /home/lucas/.shellfiles/.aliases
. /home/lucas/.shellfiles/.runtime
```

## What it is?

Many aliases of commands used on a daily basis as well as those used less frequently.

Many simple functions (which are not aliases only of the because they require parameter :) )
